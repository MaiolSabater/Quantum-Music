# Quantum-Music

This repository contains the implementation of the QuiKo framework, a quantum music generation system that merges quantum machine learning (QML) techniques with classical audio processing to create unique drum patterns. QuiKo explores the intersection of music, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing, offering an innovative approach to generative music composition. This repository is part of the final thesis in the bachelor of AI at the UAB.

## Introduction

QuiKo is a tool for generating drum beats by leveraging quantum principles such as superposition and quantum phase estimation. It analyzes audio tracks and constructs new beats based on features encoded into quantum circuits. The project aims to:

- Demonstrate the potential of quantum computing in creative domains like music.
- Serve as a bridge for understanding quantum computing concepts through music.
- Facilitate generative tasks that combine classical and quantum approaches.

This project is part of a broader effort to explore the intersection of quantum computing and music, inspired by the research outlined in the accompanying paper.

## Getting Started

This repository provides a python nootebook in order to guide and let the user obtain results. The approach in the nootebook is not very detailed technically since its objective is to provide the necessary code in order to get results. For a more technical implementation please take a look into the paper: XXX. To proceed with the tutorial, open Quantum_Beat_Generator_Tutorial.ipynb for an interactive introduction.


## How QuiKo Works

QuiKo operates in three main stages:

1. **Preprocessing**:  
   Audio samples are filtered and segmented into harmonic and percussive components. Subbands are extracted using filter banks.

2. **Quantum Encoding**:  
   Audio features are encoded into quantum circuits using Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE). This step utilizes IBM's Qiskit framework for simulation.

3. **Analysis and Beat Construction**:  
   Similarities between encoded samples are computed, and new beats are generated by sampling from a probability distribution derived from quantum measurements.
